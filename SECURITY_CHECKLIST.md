- [x] Added refresh token revocation mechanism
- [x] Included proper token expiry validation
- [x] Added logout endpoint to revoke tokens
- [x] Added revoke-all endpoint for security purposes

### 3. Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints

- [x] Installed and configured `express-rate-limit`
- [x] Applied strict rate limiting:
  - Login: 5 requests per 15 minutes
  - Register: 3 requests per hour
  - Refresh: 10 requests per 15 minutes
- [x] Added rate limiting headers to responses
- [x] Implemented IP-based rate limiting
- [x] Added informative error messages when limits exceeded
- [x] Added general rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)

### 4. Request Validation Middleware

- [x] Implemented validation using both `zod` and `express-validator`
- [x] Added validation for all authentication endpoints
- [x] Implemented strong password requirements
- [x] Added email format validation
- [x] Created reusable validation schemas
- [x] Return clear, user-friendly validation error messages
- [x] Added input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- [x] Added content-type header validation
- [x] Added file upload validation middleware

### 5. CSRF Protection

- [x] Installed and configured `csrf-csrf` (modern alternative)
- [x] Implemented double-submit cookie pattern
- [x] Added CSRF token generation for all requests
- [x] Created `/api/csrf-token` endpoint for frontend
- [x] Configured secure cookie settings
- [x] Added CSRF validation error handling

### 6. Helmet.js Security Headers

- [x] Installed and configured `helmet` middleware
- [x] Enabled Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- [x] Configured X-Content-Type-Options
- [x] Set X-Frame-Options
- [x] Added X-XSS-Protection
- [x] Configured Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) for production
- [x] Set Referrer-Policy
- [x] Customized CSP directives for app requirements

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# JWT Secrets (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<generated-secret>
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=<generated-secret>
JWT_SECRET=<generated-secret>  # Legacy compatibility

# Token Expiry
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=15m
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=7d

# Security Configuration
CSRF_SECRET=<generated-secret>
SESSION_SECRET=<generated-secret>

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=4000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Live

- [ ] Generate new secrets for production environment
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (required for HSTS and secure cookies)
- [ ] Update FRONTEND_URL to production domain
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Test all security features in staging environment
- [ ] Review and update CSP directives if needed
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Configure backup and disaster recovery

### Security Monitoring

- [ ] Monitor rate limiting logs
- [ ] Track failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Monitor token refresh patterns
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated

## üìã Testing Checklist

### Authentication Flow

- [ ] User registration with strong password validation
- [ ] User login with rate limiting
- [ ] Access token expiration (15 minutes)
- [ ] Refresh token rotation
- [ ] Logout token revocation
- [ ] Revoke all tokens functionality

### Security Features

- [ ] Rate limiting on all protected endpoints
- [ ] CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Security headers present in responses
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Invalid token handling
- [ ] Expired token handling
- [ ] Malformed request handling
- [ ] Large payload handling
- [ ] Concurrent request handling

## üîç Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
3. **Fail Secure**: Secure defaults and error handling
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
5. **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding to prevent XSS
6. **Secure Communication**: HTTPS enforcement in production
7. **Token Security**: Short-lived access tokens with rotation
8. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
9. **CSRF Protection**: Prevention of cross-site request forgery
10. **Security Headers**: Comprehensive header configuration

## üìö Additional Recommendations
